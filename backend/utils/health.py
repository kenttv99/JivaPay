"""Utility helpers to attach standard health/ready endpoints to FastAPI apps.

Usage:
    from backend.utils.health import add_health_endpoint
    add_health_endpoint(app)

This will register a simple GET /health route returning {"status": "ok"} so that
external monitoring systems and test scripts can quickly verify that the service
is alive and responsive.

    The endpoint is mounted at GET /health and always returns the JSON

    Calling this function multiple times for the same *app* is harmless â€“ the
